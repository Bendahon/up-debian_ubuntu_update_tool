# up-debian_ubuntu_update_tool


1. Description:
Bendahon - I forked this project just to make it super simple so i just have to run "up"

 Up is a tool that automates the update procedure for Debian and Ubuntu based
 Linux systems.

2. Installation:

 Unzip the "up" bash script from the zip archive and move it to either
 /usr/local/bin or ~/bin. You can either do this from a command line or simply
 drag the file out of Archive Manager to wherever you'd like it to go.

 Note: scripts that are run from the ~/bin directory cannot be prefixed with
 'sudo' as the system will fail to find them. Those who intend to run up from
 a script for cron, anacron or systemd timers should place it in /usr/local/bin
 This is also the best practice if there are more than one administrator
 accounts on the machine.
